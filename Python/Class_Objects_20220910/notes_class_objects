class - template - doesn't contains data/ just a logical plan
object - actual implementation of class/  not a logical plan it contains data
constructor - Used for Class attributes/variables declaration
	- strictly restricted to provide custom method name for constructor only
	- It should always start with __init__()
	- This is method
		* Methods are similar to functions
		* Then Diff ?
	- def __init__(self): 
		* self - mandatory argument
		* contains arguments
		* No return value
			- Reason : This method is not called/invoked manually by the developer
		* If not called manually then how this functions get executed ?
			- This __init__() constructor method will get invoked/called automatically during the creation of Object
