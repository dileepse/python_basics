strings - group of charater, can be a single word/line or multi line even - immutable
list - multiple elements stored together as a single entity - mutable
tuple - same as list but immutable
sets - multiple elements stored together as a single entity but duplicates are not allowed - mutable
dictionaries - stores data/values in Key Value format mutable

Dictionaries :
	Denoted using {}
	It stores data in Key,Value format
	We should mention key and value mandataorily.
		Key wihtout value, value without doesn't exists in a dictionary
	
	Syntax - 
		dictionary_obj = {key1:value1, key2:value2, key3:value3,....}
		Key will be either integers or strings
		Duplicates Keys are not allowed, but duplicate values are allowed.
		Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype which python

Iteratable with dictionary:		
	1.] Iterate on original dictionary(whatever the dictionary name), it will return keys only
	2.] Iterate on original dictionary keys (dict1.keys()), it will return keys only
	2.] Iterate on original dictionary values (dict1.values()), it will return keys only
